#This module builds a Network Load balancer (NLB) for public management of the Qumulo cluster with the replication port 3712 optionally enabled.
#All configuration options are specified in the root module.
#This module is NOT called from root main.tf because Terraform cannot deal with an unknown number of values prior to apply.  This is a well documented Terraform issue.
#By executing this module seperately we avoid the maintenance issues with Terraform -target
#Apply this Terraform module subsequent to applying the root module if you want public management for the Qumulo cluster
